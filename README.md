# STM32F411
Project was created for the Internship Technical Computer Science in winter semester 22/23.

Code was written for the STM32F411 microcontroller, and provides function to let a LED blink and to stop the LED from blinken with a button press.
This was implemented once in the C and once in assembler.
The whole project was implemented in the IAR Embedded Workbench for ARM (EWARM) IDE.
